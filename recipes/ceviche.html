    <h2>Description of the Dish</h2>
        <p>In Peru, ceviche has been declared part of the country's national
        heritage and has even had a holiday declared in its honor.
        [48] The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw fish, marinated in freshly squeezed key lime, with sliced
        onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was
        traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn on the cob and slices of
        cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian ají limo, or
        the Andean chili rocoto, toasted corn or cancha and yuyo (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from
        shark (tollo or tojo). Lenguado (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, similar to the
        method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was
        developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs, including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato.[49] Many Peruvian
        cevicherías serve a small glass of the marinade, which is called leche de tigre or leche de pantera, as an appetizer
        along with the fish.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <div class="ordered">
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced
            with a fork, then drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced onion in a bowl of warm water, let
            stand 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the bowl of a blender, and puree until smooth. Pour
            this mixture into a large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season with salt and pepper, then stir
            in the diced tilapia and shrimp.</li>

            leaves. Spoon the ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of potato.</li>
